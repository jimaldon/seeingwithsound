# Seeing With Sound Dataset
Seeing With Sound is a dataset designed to enable the use of ambient road noise to train models responsible for scene understanding in the context of autonomous driving. The dataset was introduced in our paper "Seeing With Sound: Long-range Acoustic Beamforming for Multimodal Scene Understanding" at CVPR 2023.
